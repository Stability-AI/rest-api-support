    Welcome to the Stability.ai REST API!

    Your DreamStudio API key will be required for authentication: [How to find your API key](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started/authentication)

    API operations use the following versioning scheme:
    - `/v*` interface is stable and ready for production workloads
    - `/v*beta*`: interface is stable, preparing for production release
    - `/v*alpha*`: under development and the interface is subject to change

    NOTE: The v1alpha and v1beta endpoints from the developer preview are still available, but they
    will disabled on May 1st, 2023.  Please migrate to the v1 endpoints as soon as possible.

    If you have feedback or encounter any issues with the API, please reach out:
